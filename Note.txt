-Type Inference:
	var email="abc@gmail.com": golang var email is default String
- var a1, b1 = 10, 11
-	var (
		name string;
		adress string;
		age int;
	)
-rune: cap phat bo nho ngay tuc thi (runes := []rune(myString))
- Map:
    + is reference type
-Struct:
        //pointer with struct
        pointer := &Student{
            999,
            "Phuc999",
        }
        fmt.Println((*pointer).name)
        fmt.Println(pointer.id)
-Pointer: var p1 = new(int)

    Write a program that models 2 vehicles (Car and Truck) and will be able to simulate driving and refueling them. Car and truck both have fuel quantity, fuel consumption in liters per km and can be driven given distance and refueled with given liters. But in the summer both vehicles use air conditioner and their fuel consumption per km is increased by 0.9 liters for the car and with 1.6 liters for the truck. Also the truck has a tiny hole in his tank and when it gets refueled it gets only 95% of given fuel. The car has no problems when refueling and adds all given fuel to its tank. If vehicle cannot travel given distance its fuel does not change.

    Implement a LinkedList in Golang with following methods
1.    func (list *LinkedList) Size() int {}
2.    func (list *LinkedList) IndexOf(value interface{}) int {}
3.    func (list *LinkedList) Get(index int) interface{} {}
4.    func (list *LinkedList) RemoveAt(index int) {}

Animal Farm
An Animal Farm contains some Chicken, Cow, and Sheep. They usually shout randomly.
-    A Chicken will give bird randomly between 1 and 5
-    A Cow and A Sheep will give bird randomly between 1 and 2. They also give us milk every day. The number of milks is between 1-5 little
Write a Golang project that take a number, then random create the animals
