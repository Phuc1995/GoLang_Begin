    Write a program that models 2 vehicles (Car and Truck) and will be able to simulate driving and refueling them. Car and truck both have fuel quantity, fuel consumption in liters per km and can be driven given distance and refueled with given liters. But in the summer both vehicles use air conditioner and their fuel consumption per km is increased by 0.9 liters for the car and with 1.6 liters for the truck. Also the truck has a tiny hole in his tank and when it gets refueled it gets only 95% of given fuel. The car has no problems when refueling and adds all given fuel to its tank. If vehicle cannot travel given distance its fuel does not change.
