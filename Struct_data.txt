Lists:
	+ A list is a sequence of elements. Each element can be connected to another with a link in a forward or backward direction. 
	+ The element can have other payload properties. This data structure is a basic type of container. 
	+ Lists have a variable length and developer can remove or add elements moreÂ easily than an array. 
	+ Data items within a list need not be contiguous in memory or on disk
	
Tuples:
	+ A tuple is a finite sorted list of elements
	+ 

Heap:
	+ The heap data structure is used in selection, graph, and k-way merge algorithms
	+ Operations such as finding, merging, insertion, key changes, and deleting are performed on heaps
	+ The value stored at each node is greater than or equal to its children.
